# unigram bigram trigram smoothing and GPT3 analysis
This project implements n-gram (unigram, bigram, trigram) language models using MLE and applies linear interpolation smoothing. It also explores GPT-3 for tasks like zero-shot and few-shot prompting, sentiment analysis, and question answering. Results include perplexity scores, model comparisons, and performance insights across tasks.
